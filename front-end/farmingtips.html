      <h2>Crop Rotation</h2>
      <p>Alternating different crops in the same area to improve soil health, optimize nutrients, and combat pest and weed pressure. This prevents the depletion of specific nutrients in the soil and reduces the build-up of pests and diseases associated with monoculture (planting the same crop repeatedly). Different plants have different nutrient needs and root systems; rotating crops helps to maintain soil fertility and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.</p>

      <h2>Natural Pest Control</h2>
      <p>Using beneficial insects, companion planting, and natural repellents to manage pests without harmful chemicals. This involves introducing natural predators to control pests, strategically planting crops that repel pests, and using plant-based or other non-toxic repellents. This approach minimizes the environmental impact of pesticides and reduces health risks.</p>

      <h2>Water Conservation</h2>
      <p>Techniques for reducing water usage including drip irrigation, water recycling, and rainwater harvesting methods. Drip irrigation delivers water directly to plant roots, reducing evaporation. Water recycling reuses treated wastewater for irrigation. Rainwater harvesting collects rainwater for later use, reducing reliance on conventional water sources. These methods conserve water resources and improve water use efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Composting Tips</h2>
      <p>How to create nutrient-rich compost from farm waste to improve soil fertility and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers. Composting involves the natural decomposition of organic matter (plant and animal waste) to create a nutrient-rich soil amendment. This reduces reliance on synthetic fertilizers, improves soil structure and water retention, and reduces the need for landfill space.</p>
